This is a demo project for [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) (Mock Service Worker) working with both [Jest](https://jestjs.io/fr/) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) using a shared set of mocked data/responses.

MSW is also enabled in development to provide mocked data (ie. it works whitout network or API server).

You can learn more about how to setup MSW and reuse mocks in our tutorial series:
